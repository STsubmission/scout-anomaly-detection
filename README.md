# SCOUT - Statistical Client Observation & Unified Tracking
*Your early warning system for GA4 anomalies across the entire STM portfolio*

## What is SCOUT?

SCOUT is an intelligent anomaly detection platform that monitors 50+ client GA4 properties, identifying issues before they become problems. Like a scout on reconnaissance, it's always first to spot patterns and report back with actionable intelligence.

**"SCOUT found it first, so you can fix it fast."**

## Core Capabilities

- üîç **Schema Discovery**: Automatically maps custom events across diverse client implementations
- ‚ö° **Multi-Method Detection**: Statistical analysis (Z-score, IQR) plus ML pattern recognition  
- üìä **Cross-Client Intelligence**: Learn from patterns across the entire portfolio
- üìß **Smart Alerting**: Morning digests via email, critical alerts via Teams
- üéØ **Business Impact Scoring**: Prioritizes anomalies by actual business impact

## Project Status
Currently in implementation phase. Foundation pipeline under construction.

## Tech Stack
- **Data Layer**: Google BigQuery (all client GA4 exports)
- **Processing**: Python Cloud Functions (batch daily)
- **ML/Analytics**: BigQuery ML, Statistical Analysis
- **Alerting**: SendGrid (email), Teams Webhooks
- **Dashboard**: Next.js + Tremor (Phase 2)
