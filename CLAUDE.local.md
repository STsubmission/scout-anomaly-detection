# Project: AnomalyInsights
Type: data-pipeline
Purpose: Automated GA4 anomaly detection system with ML insights for 50+ STM clients
Stack: BigQuery, Python, Cloud Functions, Next.js, SendGrid, Teams
Status: Planning
Created: 2025-09-25

## Place-Making Specification
**Physical Metaphor**: [Required - What physical space is this?]
- Examples: Factory, River, Mail Sorting Facility, Refinery

**Signature Element**: [The ONE unique element that appears everywhere]
- Visual, interaction, or narrative texture that defines this place
- Examples: Oil paintings, terminal green, wood grain, constellation maps

**Entry Feeling**: [First impression in 3 words]
- Examples: "Calm and focused", "Energized and ready", "Curious and exploring"

**Transformation**: User arrives as [role/state] ‚Üí leaves as [evolved role/state]
- Examples: "Analyst ‚Üí Explorer", "Manager ‚Üí Commander", "Sender ‚Üí Cultivator"

**Anti-Atmosphere**: This place is NOT:
- [Wrong metaphor that would mislead]
- [Wrong feeling that would repel]
- [Wrong optimization that would destroy atmosphere]

## Atmosphere Requirements
- [AR1] Signature element present in: [landing, app, errors, success, docs]
- [AR2] Response time feels: [instant/thoughtful/deliberate] matching metaphor
- [AR3] Error messages feel: [helpful/protective/guiding] not harsh
- [AR4] Success moment triggers: [celebration/satisfaction/power] feeling
- [AR5] Beneficial friction at: [specify where/why we slow users down]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Always Check Dependencies First
**YOU MUST** read STATE.md before starting ANY work to see what's ready to implement.

## üéØ Current Sprint Focus
[Update this each session with 1-2 key goals]

## üìö Project Commands
\\\ash
# Testing (adjust for your project type)
# Add your test commands here
\\\

## üîß Development Workflow (FOLLOW THIS EXACTLY)

### Starting a Session:
1. Run \/project:wbs-status\ to see current state
2. Read STATE.md ‚Üí Check what's ready to build
3. Pick highest priority unblocked feature
4. Announce what you're working on

### Implementing a Feature:
1. **Write tests FIRST** based on success criteria
2. Run tests ‚Üí Verify they fail
3. Implement minimal code to pass tests
4. Refactor if needed (tests still pass)
5. Update STATE.md conversationally
6. Commit with message: \eat(FeatureName): description\

### Before Committing:
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No lint errors
- [ ] STATE.md updated
- [ ] Dependencies documented

## üíª Code Standards (IMPORTANT)
- **Line length**: Max 80 characters
- **Function size**: <50 lines, single responsibility
- **Variable names**: Descriptive (userAuthToken not token)
- **Comments**: Only for "why", not "what"
- **Error handling**: Never silently fail

## üì¶ WBS Features Specification

**AWAITING WBS DEFINITION**

This project requires What-Boundaries-Success definition through Claude Code planning session.

### Expected Structure:
\\\
Feature: FeatureName {
  What:
    - "Specific requirement 1" [R1]
      ‚Üí provides: capability-1
      ‚Üí atmosphere: supports [metaphor element]
    - "Specific requirement 2" [R2]
      ‚Üí needs: capability-1
      ‚Üí provides: capability-2
      ‚Üí atmosphere: includes [signature element]
  
  Boundaries:
    - Performance: "Response <200ms"
    - Scale: "100 concurrent users"
    - Tech: "Must use PostgreSQL"
    - Atmosphere: "Load time max 3s for texture"
  
  Success Criteria (Test these):
    - "User can complete X in <60 seconds"
    - "System handles Y without errors"
    - "All [R#] requirements validated"
    - "User describes feeling [intended emotion]"
  
  Effort: ~4 hours
  Priority: High
  Status: [ ] Not Started
  
  When Done:
    - Enables: [list of unblocked features]
    - Validates: [business goal]
    - Atmosphere: [transformation step achieved]
}
\\\

### Planning with Place-Making:
When defining features with Claude Code, ensure EVERY feature:
1. Exists naturally in your physical metaphor
2. Includes the signature element somewhere
3. Advances the user transformation
4. Respects beneficial friction points

## üö´ Anti-Requirements (DO NOT BUILD)
[To be defined during planning - what's explicitly OUT of scope]

## üîÑ Implementation Order
[To be determined after WBS definition and dependency analysis]
